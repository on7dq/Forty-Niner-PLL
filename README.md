# Forty-Niner-PLL
Another 49â€™er project with a digital VFO

This project started as a basic 49er project, based on the QST article from March 2016, by Jack Purdum W8TEE et al.
"A Modular 40 Meter CW Transceiver with VFO".

Some changes were needed though.

The AD9850 DDS for the VFO has become difficult to source, and very expensive, so it was replaced by a Si5351 module.

A similar acrylic case for the project was found, it's the box of a video tape of the Philips VCR standard (1971).

This project is a work in progress, as we are still adding some stuff, but the software is already very capable.
Features that are already implemented are: 
Selection of band and band limits, 
Adjustable OFFSET with corresponding sidetone, 
PTT delay, 
WPM (for built-in messages),
Beacon or Autorepeat timer for automatic transmission timing.

Receive functions : RIT, SPLIT and SPOT.
Selection of pre-programmed CQ or Beacon messages, with adjustable beaconing time up to 90 minute.
All parameters, the last used frequency and, the RIT and SPLIT status are stored in EEPROM in the Arduino.

The code includes a DDS routine for generation of a pure sinewave sidetone, and a calibration routine for the Si5351 to 1/100th of a Hz.

Download the .ino files separately, or just download the zip file and unzip it on you PC.
Put all .ino files in a folder named "49PLL-V100".
Open the main program 49PLL-V100.ino, edit your callsign, band limits, your messages etc, then compile and send the code to the Arduino.
You may have to install the libraries for the rotary encoder and the Si5351. 
If you have trouble compiling, send me an e-mail via my QRZ.COM address.
